									<h3 class="major">Project Summary</h3>
									<p>This project is my first attempt at using the state machine pattern. I decided to implement this by creating a herding mechanic for a "sheep" object, that simultaneously implements both fleeing and roaming behaviours, controlled by a state machine.<br>This work was a solo project, however I still aimed to keep my code modular, and continued to implement good programming practices, including interfaces and abstract classes.</p>
									<p>This work was completed as part of my second-year gameplay programming module. A demo of this project can be found <a href="Herding/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

										<p><span class="image left"><a href="images/Abstract.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/Abstract.png"></a></span>Building a state machine was my first attempt at using abstract classes and enforcing good programming techniques, such as the use of Interfaces for easier class implementation. <br> 
										I could also implement a method for avoiding the boundaries of the arena, that would be applied before each movement call as I often had issues with my sheep being stuck at the walls during testing.<br>Each of my states would then be implemented as new classes, that would inherit from my state abstract class. I could then switch between states and the required methods within my State Machine script.</p>

										<p><span class="image right"><a href="images/HerdingBehavior.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/HerdingBehavior.png"></a></span>Implementing the herding behaviour was initially more challenging as I needed it to apply simultaneously with the fleeing and roaming states.<br>Eventually, I figured out a solution that had the Herding behaviour apply as an offset to the agent's target position, which would be added just before the movement was applied.</p>
