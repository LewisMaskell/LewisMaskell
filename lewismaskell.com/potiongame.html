									<h3 class="major">Project Summary</h3>
									<p>This project was a group project as part of my first-year final game development project.<br>This project was a test of our collaborative skills, and was the first game development project with a provided brief.</p>
									<p>Our brief was to create a potion-making tycoon game. My main contribution to this project was creating a queue system for incoming orders and NPC's to line up. It was essential that my code remained modular, with as little external dependencies as possible, as this was also my first time closely collaborating with a second programmer. <br>To Implement my queue system, I decided to use prefabs for each of the NPC's that walk into the shop. The expereince gained using this technique has since been applied in many of my other projects, and will remain an essential part of my Unity programming knowledge.</p><p>A more detailed insight into this project alongside examples of my code in this solution can be found <a href="PDFs/PotionGame.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
