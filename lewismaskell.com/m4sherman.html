									<h3 class="major">Project Summary</h3>
									<p>This project is my assessment piece for my 3d modelling module that i took in my first year.  <br>For this project, I decided to model an m4 sherman, as it allowed me to practice several different modelling techniques. With these basic skills, I am capable of producing simple 3d models for use in my own games, where a dedicated 3d artist may not be available.<br>I have been able to apply these skills in many different scenarios since completing the module, allowing me to remain a well-rounded game developer.<br>
									While taking this module, I also learnt about the technical side behind how 3d models and textures are stored and manipulated in different programs. This understanding has allowed me to collaborate more effecitvely with 3d artists in projects since, including work I have completed outside of game development context, detailed <a href="tamperseal.html">here.</a>  </p>
									<p>A video breakdown of how I completed the project and the issues that I faced can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/PbPic44K7y0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
