									<h3 class="major">Project Summary</h3>
									<p>The aim of this project was to create a Battleships game in Unreal Engine. The primary goals were to buils a complete gameplay loop and gain experience in Unreal Engine.<br> This project was part of my first-year game programming modules, and was a chance for me to practice using Unreal Engine.</p>
									<p>The largest obstacle in this project was to create an object oriented, tile-based grid. Building object oriented code is an essential skill for industry work, and was one of the reasons why I chose this project.<p>For this project, I wanted the game to be played by two people on the same device. As a result, I also had to store the state of the board each time a turn ended. Without any explicit 2D array structures in blueprints, I ended up having to store each tile object, including x,y coordinates and status in a 1-Dimensional array. Doing so allowed me to work around this issue.</p>A review of the project can be found <a href="PDFs/battleships.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
